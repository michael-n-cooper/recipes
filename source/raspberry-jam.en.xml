    <title>Raspberry Jam</title>

        <processnote>Raspberry jam is wonderful but easily develops a "cooked" taste that detracts from the brightness of the berries. To minimize that, this recipe boils off water before adding sugar (which would increase cooking temperature and flavour loss) and pre-heats the sugar to reduce the amount of time bringing the batch back up to temperature after adding it. Raspberries also have lots of seeds that can dominate the jam, so this recipe removes some of them while keeping enough to retain the character.</processnote>

        <step>Preheat an oven to <temperature>215</temperature>.</step>
        <step>Put the sugar in the oven and warm to the oven's temperature, at least <time>1 hour</time>.</step>
        <step>Fill a canning kettle with water to the appropriate level and bring to boil. Reduce heat and keep ready at the boil until the jam is ready. Sterilize <equipment>canning jars</equipment> and lids.</step>
        <step>Run the raspberries through the fine plate of a food mill to remove seeds. Mill completely to remove as much pulp from around the seeds as possible.</step>
        <step>Return about half the seeds to the batch. Discard the rest.</step>
        <step>Put the raspberries in a pot with at least three times the capacity of the batch.</step>
        <step>Bring batch to a boil. Keep at the boil, stirring occasionally, until the volume drops noticeably and mixture starts to thicken.</step>
        <step>Add the hot sugar to the raspberries, stir in to dissolve, and return to the boil. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the batch reaches <temperature>215</temperature>.</step>
