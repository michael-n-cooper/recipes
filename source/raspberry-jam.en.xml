    <title>Raspberry Jam</title>

        <dishtype>Jams</dishtype>
        <processnote>Raspberry jam is wonderful but easily develops a "cooked" taste that detracts from the brightness of the berries. To minimize that, this recipe boils off water before adding sugar (which would increase cooking temperature and flavour loss) and pre-heats the sugar to reduce the amount of time bringing the batch back up to temperature after adding it. Raspberries also have lots of seeds that can dominate the jam, so this recipe removes some of them while keeping enough to retain the character.</processnote>
